###About Rooted & Wild Co.
Rooted and Wild is, my dear friend, Mackenzie Myers's personal website, featuring her floral designs. The shop element of the site is not something Mackenzie will be using. I implemented it for learning purposes.

* Launch using gulp
* Add liking system to blogs
* Make the site more responsive
    * Images on work page to become a scroll down instead of slideshow
    * Logo in navbar disappear and new one placed below it
* Blog pagination

* Add her instagram feed
* Add arrows to the price sorting
* Add a quck view option to main shop page
* Enlarge images on click in blogs
